        <p class="lead">Born in 1989 and raised in Chicago, Illinois until I was 26. I moved out to the Bay Area with my wife nearly 4 years ago and have not looked back since. My love for art has 
          directed me down a path that has led to me seeing some pretty amazing things. From houses I never thought I would step foot in, to priceless objects I never thought I 
        would get to see in real life.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12">
        <p class="lead">I enjoy spending time with my wife when I am not working as an art technician. Living in Oakland we have really taken a liking to being outdoors. Every weekend we try and take
          advantage by going on a hike or exploring some new part of the bay area. Our favorite places so far range from Monterey Bay south, Sebastapol up north, and the Redwood Regional park that
          sits only a 15 minute drive to the east of our home. To say we are spoiled by the amount of outdoor activity aviable is definitely an understatement. Coming from the Midwest where weather 
          determines if you are able to go outside rarely applies out here. Every day is seemingly perfect weather.

        <p class="lead">As much as a I love the art world and thought as a young adult it would be my life forever, I have come into a new interest in computer science. I enrolled in a bootcamp at UC
          Berekeley Extension which began in February of 2019. SO far I have learned an incredible amount in such a short period of time. I am amazed by the capabilities of this technology and have definitely
          found a new passion for a field I would love to become an expert in one day. Thanks to bootcamp I am able to present my skills through this website. I hope you enjoy and I look forward to constantly
          improving this space as I continue to learn more skills!
